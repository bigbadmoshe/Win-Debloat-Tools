# ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is now archived

**Final words:** Thank you all for participating in this project. It was a small project at first, but over time it became my graduation project. Now, it's big enough for me to be proud of. However, I couldn't handle the project's size. I apologize if I disappointed anyone or caused any headaches due to the script's functionality. But this time, I'm formally ending the project. Feel free to fork it and modify it however you like. I started to prioritized other things in my personal life, and as I didn't felt motivated to change other parts or solve the problems, I decided to close the project and be responsible. Take care!

**_Re-imagining Windows like a minimal OS install, already debloated with minimal impact for most functionality._**

> [!WARNING] > **DISCLAIMER:** _You're doing this at your own risk, I am not responsible for any data loss or damage that may occur. It's not guaranteed that every feature removed from the system can be easily restored._

## üöÄ Download Latest Version

Code located in the `main` branch is considered bleeding-edge, but big features/reworks will be implemented in a separate branch.

> [!IMPORTANT] > _Use on a fresh Windows install to notice the differences. Using an admin account is recommended to avoid any compatibility issues._

## ‚ú® Usage

**To run a variant of the script, follow these steps:**

- Extract the **entire** `.zip` file to another folder.
- Run `OpenTerminalHere.cmd` (try to `run as admin` if nothing happens at all).
- Copy and Paste one of the lines below on your **Terminal** to unblock the scripts and execute it:

### GUI Version

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force; ls -Recurse *.ps*1 | Unblock-File; .\"WinDebloatTools.ps1"
```

<div align="center">

![Script GUI](./src/assets/script-gui.png)
_The `Apply Tweaks` button is the main one for debloating._

</div>

### **CLI Version** (Straight to debloat)

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force; ls -Recurse *.ps*1 | Unblock-File; .\"WinDebloatTools.ps1" 'CLI'
```

**[Scripts](./src/scripts) can be run individually, pick what you need.**

## üîÑÔ∏è Roll-Back

**If something breaks you can rely on:**

1. If you want **(almost)** everything to it's original state, use the `Undo Tweaks` button on [`WinDebloatTools.ps1`](./WinDebloatTools.ps1).
2. A restoration point done by the script itself;
3. The `Repair Windows` button on [`WinDebloatTools.ps1`](./WinDebloatTools.ps1);
